# Roll a Dice - Random Walk Simulation

## Overview

### This project is a simple Random Walk Simulation using dice rolls using Jupyter notebook. I modelled a random walk process where the next step is determined by rolling a six-sided die, with specific rules for movement. The simulation is visualized using Matplotlib.
